a game about inventing potions and trading with the townspeople and travelers.

inspired by adarkroom/Candybox and games like Stardew Valley, this is a javascript game about gardening, brewing potions, and exploring the world :D it's made on the three.js framework and my first venture into Webgl.

my goal is to make something meditative and relaxing, and interesting to mess around with.
